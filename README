INIT_DEVICES.PY:

w810eom: starting eom810 freq, which is the freq/length of cavity.

        120: is found to be resonant with D2line+35 MHz up.370.01335

        Subject to change. Only required to be in the vicinity of the supposed
        value as the lock will find the correct one.

MAIN.PY:

w_ref:  probe freq value that is used in checking transmission stage.
        supposed to be resonant with w810eom/cavity mentioned above
        360: =D2 line F=2->F=3

w_ref_res:  freq of probe to check the freq of cavity in the checkspectrum stage
            supposed to be equal to w_ref

w_ref_ext:  freq of probe to check the ext.
            when set, should give freq of probe equal to D2+ACstarkshift

EX: Case 1: To set cavity resonant with D2+35MHz:
            w810eom=150
            w_ref=395
            w_ref_ext:395
            w_ref_res=395

    Case 2: To set the cavity resonant with D2+25MHz:
            w810eom=150
            w_ref=385
            w_ref_ext:395
            w_ref_res=385


Tref:       Value of Tranmission of probe/780nm used as a target for the transverse lock
tolerance:  Tolerance of Tref for the transverse lock

Tref_810:   Similar to the above but for 810
tolerance_810:
